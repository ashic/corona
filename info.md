### BoJo and Cummings are killing us coz eugenics

Some of the best epidemiologists, virologists, and other experts working in top notch institutions are analysing, modelling, and advising the government. The Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Witty and the Chief Scientific Offcier, Sir Patrick Vallance are front and centre of everything. This thread outlines some of the work that's being done:

The following is a list of some of the project and papers:

Truth be told, I'm quite surprised by the fact that BoJo is letting the experts lead. It would be politically much easier to follow WHO procedures, along the same lines as "you never get fired for hiring IBM". 

### Why is the government doing nothing?

At the first briefing, the advice was that anybody with symptoms should stay home for 7 days, and if they didn't improve, to call 111 (the NHS hotline). Premier League football was cancelled, as were numerous other things. The government didn't officially recommend working from home, but many companies - specially in London - started making that the norm. 

A few days later, more strict measures have been brought in. People are advised to self isolate on symptoms - for 14 days if they're in a household, told to avoid non-essential contact, avoid gatherings, work from home if they can, etc. 

At the time of these recommendations (March 16, 2020), the UK is behind most other countries we're looking at in our charts in terms of time since breakout, and in terms of numbers. As such, our "nothing" measures are actually one of the most strict in a comparable timeframe. 

### But the numbers are false, they've stopped testing

The UK has not stopped testing. If anything, they've increased testing. What they've said is that unless you've had symptoms for 7 days, they aren't going to test you (unless you're in a high risk group - or probably somebody famous). Three levels of testing have been outlined, and only geographic testing has been curtailed. The reason for this is that people with sniffles, minor symptoms, etc. have been getting tested, and it's been overwhelming 111. Normally, early detection is recommended, but in this case - where we don't have a cure, all early detection can do is tell you to take measures to not infect others. If you're self isolating for 7 days when symptoms arise, you're not infecting others. A positive test would not change your next steps one bit. If you're in a high risk group, or your symptoms get significantly worse, then the 7 day wait thing goes out of the window, doesn't it? 

As of March 11, 2020, the per capita testing across some countries are outlined in this chart:

Another thing worth noting is that the golden standard in handling thus far seems to be Vietnam. They've been well prepared since SARS with a multitude of things in place. And yet, they have some of the lowest per capita testing numbers.

### Accurate numbers are important, how do we get that without testing?

Various statistical approaches are used, however an important issue is that the actual infections out there are an order of magnitude higher the confirmed cases. As of March 16, 2020, the number of confirmed cases in the UK is 1144. However, the actual expected total cases are between 10-20,000. Yes, four zeroes. And doubling every five days. For some other major European countries, the expected cases are in the six figures already. Getting hold of actual numbers while it's spreading is extremely difficult, and part of ongoing research. 100 confirmations here, or 200 confirmations there are drops in the ocean compared to the actual count. 

Another challenge is that for most of the infected, there are little to no symptoms. And the symptoms are very similar the common fly, or even common colds. As such, there's a whole lot of infections out there that were never tested, but the people recovered. At present, the test we have tell us if a person currently is infected. Researchers are trying to develop a test that would tell us if somebody contracted and overcame it in the past.
